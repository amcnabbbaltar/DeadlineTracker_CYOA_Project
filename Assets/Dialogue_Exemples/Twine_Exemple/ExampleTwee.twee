:: Start
You find yourself in a cheerful forest clearing, illuminated by a cozy campfire. In front of you is a group of cultists, dressed in matching red robes that look more like cozy pajamas. One cultist waves excitedly and speaks in a surprisingly chipper voice, "Hello there! If you want to keep exploring our lovely forest, you'll need to solve a little riddle first. Just a bit of fun, really!"

:: Walk Away
You decide not to play along with the cultists' game and turn to leave. But as you step away, you hear a gentle rustling, and suddenly, you find yourself right back where you started. "Oh, don’t be like that," a cultist teases, "We’re just having some fun! Give the riddle a try!"

:: Proceed Deeper
With a friendly wave, the cultists step aside, allowing you to continue down the path. As you walk, the forest around you seems to shimmer with excitement. Ahead, you see the path split into two—one side looks well-traveled, and the other seems a bit more mysterious and overgrown.
